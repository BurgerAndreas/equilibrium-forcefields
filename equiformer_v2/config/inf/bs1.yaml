# Only useful for evaluate=True (not training).
# When evaluating fixed-point reuse in DEQs, it is better to use eval_batch_size=1.
# test_patches will concat multiple consecutive streaks of idxs for the test set,
# e.g. for test_patch_size=200: idx=[42,...242,50042,...50242,100042,...100242,150042,...150242]
# make sure that for post-processing you exclude the jumps in idxs every test_patch_size
